My journey with mental health and a few tips I'd like to share with the world.

I've been struggling with mental health my entire life. A lot of things played role in my current state of mind but the most important one is how I grew up. Let's just say it wasn't the healthiest of ways. That on top of some family history with mental illness and trauma kinda fucked me up honestly. I couldn't imagine my life without anxiety. After a few years of trying different therapists I've finally managed to find one that fits my standards and I've been seeing her almost every week for the past 1 year and 2 months.

Therapy has helped me in a lot of ways. I've managed to regulate my mood and change my way of thinking to a degree. I've become better at socializing and handling difficult situations with people, I've released some of my anger and my frustration in a healthy way and improve my self esteem. It's life saving for me. I am not going to lie though, it takes *A LOT* of effort to become even the slightest better. I first had to change a lot of things about my lifestyle to get out of that stupid hell hole. I had to become more active, go outside more, eat healthier and sleep better in order to be in the appropriate mindset. What does appropriate mindset mean you might ask? Well you can't really help yourself if you aren't thinking straight, if everything is foggy and unclear. I was already eating healthier due to a diet I was on to lose 20kg (and I did and I'm still eating healthier since) and was sleeping okay-ish and only recently did I start actively going to the gym. So I fixed my life...right?

Unfortunately, since the start of 2023 I've little by little started to get worse. I first started to notice it when my crying episodes became panic attacks. I could feel every single vein in my body and my heart beating, my chest to hurt, I would cry uncontrollably and pray to God it stopped. Due to my heart beating so fast I thought I was going to die from a heart attack which caused me even more anxiety and thus creating a loop. I was hysteric. I couldn't drink coffee because it would raise my anxiety from already 100 to 200. My fears became more intense and changed from one thing to another. I couldn't concetrate for the life of me. I would be on edge every single day. I would get mentally exhausted every time I talked to anyone. My insomnia became worse. I exhausted myself every day and still couldn't sleep. My legs would be restless and my mind would be racing. I tried melatonin and other natural ways to sleep and nothing helped. I didn't try everything in my power to sleep, I could have cut caffeine completely and avoid screens at night so I guess I could do better in that department.

At some point I mentioned all this to my therapist and she suggested I see a psychiatrist to get medication because after a year she told me she might not be able to help me anymore. After a lot of hesitation I did and he prescribed me Escitalopram (ENLIFT is the brand name and it's an antidepressant). I can't describe in how much denial I was. Did I REALLY need to be put on medication? Am I not strong enough? Can I not overcome this in any other way? The side effects scared the shit out of me to the point that I would rather kill myself than experience any of those. I did a lot of reasearch, read through tons of reddit posts (yea....not the most trustworthy source but I didn't know where else to look), watched videos on how exactly they work, read some papers comparing different anti depressants, talked a lot to my therapist and friends with similar experiences and after a month of consideration I gave in. I should also mention that 4 different doctors have recommended me to seek psychiatric help because my anxiety started to take a toll on my body (high blood sugar, high blood pressure, hair loss).

Have they worked? Wouldn't know but I REALLY hope they do. I'm still experiencing the symptoms I described earlier to some degree so basically I'm still in pain. I'm on day 2 right now and the only side effect I really feel is nausea which isn't that bad either. I think I'm going to be okay because I'm getting the help I need. I will update this post once I reach the 5 week mark because that's when it's supposed to kick in. In the meantime I will be documenting every day with my symptoms just incase it fucks me up.

In conclusion, please take care of yourself. Prioritize your own well being as selfish as it seems. No one is normal, there is no right or wrong way to get better. Never hesitate to ask for help. Avoid people who aren't happy for your progress. Before I end this post I would like to give some tips to whoever is reading that I wish I knew when starting therapy.

* As I mentioned earlier you need to take care of your basic needs. Along with therapy you should focus on improving your diet, improving your sleep, getting more sunlight and being more active. I know it's cliche but us humans can't function if we don't properly take care of those needs first. Surrounding yourself with people that actually care about you and love you is also a basic need. 
* Track yourself. Track your habits, track your moods, track almost everything. Humans are a species of habit and pattern. Once you notice the habit and pattern you can break it. Inform your therapist about them too. 
* Not every therapist is a good therapist. Don't ever hesitate to switch if they don't meet your standards. Try both men and women of different ages and see what you're comfortable with.
* Always have a specific topic to talk about. If it's your first time then write down key points in your life so it's easier for you to open up. One topic will lead to another and another and another till you find what is holding you back in your subconscious.
* Be patient. I've been seeing therapists ever since I was 15 aka 7 years now. Only on the 6th year I started seeing a difference and actually making a change in my life. I guess growing up also plays a big role in that. 
* Every therapist has their own ways of treating a patient however you should encourage yours to teach you ways to cope temporary. If you feel foggy you can ground yourself by examining the environment around you. If you are stressed you can take deep breaths and learn to control it for some time.
* Don't expect therapy to magically heal you because it won't. It's up to YOU. YOU are in control of yourself and your mind. Nothing will change in your life if you don't change how you're thinking. You put in the most work not not only during your session but after as well. Every single day is a test.
* Don't expect everything from them either. If they are good they will guide you. Doing my own research and talking to people with similar experiences has also helped to find my own ways to cope.
* I can't describe how much time it takes to understand yourself. It's never too late. 
* Believe you can get better. If you want to become better you will. If you want to change your life around you will. No matter how bad things are never lose hope.
